# DeepLabV3+ Semantic Segmentation â€“ 4-Week 

The journey for these few weeks have been mostly learning the concepts, libraries, techniques used in semantic segmentation and deep learning, from the following an implementation begins
so here is what I learnt in the few weeks.

## Week-wise Summary

### Week 1: Deep Learning Fundamentals 

**Topics Covered:**

- Neural networks: structure, forward and backward propagation  
- Loss functions: Cross-Entropy, optimizers like SGD and Adam  
- Activation functions: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh  
- Concepts of overfitting, regularization, and dropout  

---

### Week 2: CNNs and Encoder-Decoder Architectures

**Topics Covered:**

- Convolutional layers: filters, padding, stride, pooling  
- CNNs for image classification (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)  
- Encoder-decoder architecture for vision tasks  
- Overview of U-Net and early segmentation models  

---

### Week 3: Semantic Segmentation Basics

**Topics Covered:**

- Semantic segmentation vs classification and detection  
- Core architectures: FCN, U-Net, PSPNet  
- Evaluation metrics: IoU (Intersection over Union), Pixel Accuracy, Confusion Matrix  
- Class imbalance handling in per-pixel classification
